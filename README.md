Food Delivery is a mobile application that will allow customers to choose from different categories and display their price and description.

For this build I used a list for simplicity but this could have used a cloud database instead in order to update and change the applications whenever and without updating the application.

Some unique features of this application is that it is getting the images from a url instead of it being embedded in the app which allows for less size of the overall application. However to beat the problem of images not loading fast or if the user is offline is that I used a cache network which allows for images to load faster and have a loading bar if it cannot be loaded.

Another unique feature is that if the user clicks on an item it will store it by the correct name in the cart and will add different quantities depending on if the customer has added multiple of the same (Please refer to the video for clarification ). Once the items are in the cart it will in real time calculate the total cost as well as the total for the quantities.

If a user wishes to delete the item then they can simply hold down the item and drag and drop it into the bin icon which will remove it from the quantities , cost and the cart.

I hope you have enjoyed looking at this application.
